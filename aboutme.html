										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/hoshi.jpg" alt="Hoshi" /></span><strong>I have a cat, and her name is Hoshi.</strong> I adopted her in 2018 from a rescue shelter in Portland, OR, and we've beeen best buds ever since. You can usually find her snuggling in my lap while I try to work on the computer, or lounging in her cat tree staring at the birds and squirrels outside.
											<p>She loves stinky wet food, chasing lasers, chin scratches, and playing fetch (except she never brings the toy back -__-).</p>
											<p>She is not a fan of closed doors, vacuum cleaners, or strangers.</p>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/snatch.GIF" alt="Snatch" style="" /></span><strong>I love strength training.</strong> I originally began with powerlifting in 2014, then about 2 years later I began learning Olympic weightlifting at a gym in Portland. 
											<p>I took some time off from lifting while I finished up undergrad and moved back to California to begin working, and recently got back into it about a year ago. Aside from helping me stay healthy, I also love the community around the sport- I've made some of my closest friends through lifting.</p>
											<p>I'm hoping to compete in my second competition sometime later this year! </p>

									<!-- Box 3 -->

									<div class="box">
										<p><br><span class="image left"><img src="images/eldenring.gif" alt="" /></span><strong>I'm really into PC gaming.</strong> Well, all gaming actually- but most of the gaming I do these days is on PC.</p>
									<p>My interest in gaming goes waaaaaaaay back to when I was growing up with my dad, and he would play Street Fighter with me on our PlayStation. From there I became obsessed with the Pokemon series on GameBoy devices, and tons of other console games throughout the years.</p>
									<p>Some of my all-time favorites are: Pokemon | Splinter Cell | Skyrim | Stardew Valley | Shin Megami Tensei | Street Fighter | Mortal Kombat | Need4Speed | Elder Scrolls</p>
									<p>...And some of my favorite games at the moment are: Elden Ring | World War Z | Dead by Daylight | Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Storm | Monster Hunter | DOOM </p>
									<p>If you also enjoy some gaming, feel free to add me!

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/aerial.jpg" alt="" style=""/></span><strong>I've recently become interested in circus arts, mainly aerial silks.</strong> I found a few local studios in the Sacramento area that have classes, and decided to take one last December (2021), and I've been hooked ever since! 
											<p>It's the perfect combination of flexibility, strength, and creativity- not to mention a killer workout (lol). It's been a fun and challenging addition to my neverending list of hobbies :)</p>
											<p>Sometime later this year I'd also like to branch out to other circus arts including aerial hoop and trapeze. </p>
